After the SOA domain is set up, you can:

* Monitor the SOA instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See [Monitoring a domain](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-monitoring-exporter).
* Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.
See [Publish logs to Elasticsearch](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-logging-exporter).
